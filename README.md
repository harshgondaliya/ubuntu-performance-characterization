# Performance Characterization of ThinkPad T470 running Ubuntu 20.04.2
This repository contains C program files used measure and analyze the performance of CPU, OS services (process vs. task creation time, context switch time), memory (cache vs. RAM access time, RAM bandwidth, page fault service time), network (application-level round-trip time, peak bandwidth, connection overhead), and file system (file cache size, local vs. remote file read time, contention) for Lenovo ThinkPad T470 running Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS.

[`report.pdf`](https://github.com/harshgondaliya/ubuntu-performance-characterization/blob/main/report.pdf) presents the results obtained during this study.

This project was executed as a part of the CSE 221 Operating Systems course offered by Prof. Geoffrey Voelker at UC San Diego.
